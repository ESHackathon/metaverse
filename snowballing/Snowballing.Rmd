## Backward Snowballing   
### finding past papers      
- Start with one (or a few) articles that are relevant to your topic. Let's call this **F0**.        
- Take all the papers from the reference list of F0 - let's call these F-1         
- Take all the papers from the reference list of F-1 articles, and so on     

## Forward Snowballing  
### finding recent papers          
- Take all the papers that cite F0 - let's call these F1         
- Take all the papers from the reference list of F-1 articles, and so on

"The aim of our study was to audit the origin of primary sources in a wide ranging systematic review of complex evidence."       
"Only 30% of sources were obtained from the protocol defined at the outset of the study (that is, from the database and hand searches). Fifty one per cent were identified by “snowballing” (such as pursuing references of references), and 24% by personal knowledge or personal contacts."

"Objective: This paper presents guidelines for conducting literature reviews using a snowballing approach, and they are illustrated and evaluated by replicating a published systematic literature review."     
"Conclusions: It is concluded that using snowballing, as a first search strategy, may very well be a good alternative to the use of database searches."

#*Background*     
Snowballing involves recursively pursuing relevant references cited in the retrieved literature and adding them to the search results. Snowballing is an alternative approach to discover additional evidence that was not retrieved through conventional search. Snowballing’s effectiveness makes it best practice in systematic reviews despite being time-consuming and tedious.     
*Objective*     
Our goal was to evaluate an automatic method for citation snowballing’s capacity to identify and retrieve the full text and/or abstracts of cited articles.     
*Methods*     
Using 20 review articles that contained 949 citations to journal or conference articles, we manually searched Microsoft Academic Search (MAS) and identified 78.0% (740/949) of the cited articles that were present in the database. We compared the performance of the automatic citation snowballing method against the results of this manual search, measuring precision, recall, and F1 score.     
*Results*     
The automatic method was able to correctly identify 633 (as proportion of included citations: recall=66.7%, F1 score=79.3%; as proportion of citations in MAS: recall=85.5%, F1 score=91.2%) of citations with high precision (97.7%), and retrieved the full text or abstract for 490 (recall=82.9%, precision=92.1%, F1 score=87.3%) of the 633 correctly retrieved citations.     
*Conclusions*     
The proposed method for automatic citation snowballing is accurate and is capable of obtaining the full texts or abstracts for a substantial proportion of the scholarly citations in review articles. By automating the process of citation snowballing, it may be possible to reduce the time and effort of common evidence surveillance tasks such as keeping trial registries up to date and conducting systematic reviews.#
